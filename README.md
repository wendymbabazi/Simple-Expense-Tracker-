# **Simple Expense Tracker (UGX)**

### **The Skill: Data Integrity & Financial Operations**

**Why I built this:**
Managing project budgets or office expenses requires extreme attention to detail. I built this tracker to automate the math and ensure that financial records remain accurate. It’s a direct application of the "integrity check" logic I used during my time as a **Data Officer**, where ensuring 100% accuracy was a daily requirement.

**How it works:**

* **Data Persistence:** It uses `localStorage` to keep your records safe. Even if you refresh your browser or close the tab, your expenses remain saved.
* **Dynamic Calculations:** The total updates instantly as you add, edit, or remove items, eliminating the risk of manual calculation errors.
* **Inline Editing:** I implemented a "Save/Edit" flow that allows users to correct entries without deleting them—a key feature for maintaining clean datasets.
* **Localized for Uganda:** I specifically formatted the tool for **UGX** to make it practical for local business use.

**The Impact:**
This project shows I can bridge the gap between technical data management and a user-friendly interface. It replicates the same workflow I used to **increase data accuracy by 70%** in high-pressure environments by removing the "guesswork" from data entry.
